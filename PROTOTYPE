DISCOVERIES
-Prototypes are a property that all functions come with. This property is another object.
- _proto_ : Whenever an instance is created using the keyword "new", that instance object is given a property called _proto_ (Which you can access using dot notation, potentially even bracket notation).
- _proto_ Value: The value of the _proto_ property, is the value of the prototype property of the function that created it.

I need to continue working with prototypes
