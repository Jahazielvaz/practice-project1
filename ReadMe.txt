DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this project is to internalize techniques that I've learned in my previous tutorials

NEW CONCEPTS TO INTERNALIZE/LOOK INTO
-Building an image carousel: Look the Image Switcher Click and Dblclick Event Section.
-document.createElement('div'): This way you can dynamically create elements. It's useful for saving lines of code as well as adding dynamic features.
-.appendChild('div'): Adds a new child element to the target element.
-screen.width / screen.height : Gives you, your computer screen's width size. Or your screen's height size, depending on what you choose
