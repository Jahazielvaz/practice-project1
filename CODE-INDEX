INTRO: Every project is going to have an index from now on. This index is going to contain titles of the concepts the individual project deals with, as well as the syntax for each of them. The purpose of this, is to be able to have a section to quickly navigate through to find the concepts we might need at the time, and to be able to get the syntax quickly in order to be able to apply them more efficiently

                            EVENTS

ADDING EVENTS:
  let eventFire = () => console.log('Page has been scrolled');

  myTarget.addEventListener('scroll', eventFire, false)

REMOVING EVENT LISTENERS: Note:(It'll remove the event listener, but not the effects already caused by the listener. You must remove those manually within the event remover function)
  let eventRemove = () => {
    myTarget.removeEventListener('scroll', eventFire)
    }

    myButton.addEventListener('click', eventRemove, false)

EVENTS: Look at the EVENTSLIST file.
