INTRO: Here's the list of events we've chosen to internalized. We'll practice each of them multiple times, until we can atleast remember all of them without having to look them up.

CHECKLIST IN ORDER FOR ADDEVENTLISTENER TO BE CONSIDERED LVL3
-Learn how to use event removers
-Learn how to use js's other way of calling events (You don't have to internalize it perfectly, you just need to be aware that it exists and how to deal with it when you see it.)
-Have the list of specific events you want to learn (We'll call this mastery list)
-Know them each by heart and what they do (Practice them on the dom)
-Have a list of potentials (It's going to be called Mastery Potentials, and include events here that you find pretty cool. Practice learning them everyday little by little.)
-Use the event reference everyday, and put it on your main dock.
