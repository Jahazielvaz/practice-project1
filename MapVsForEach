MAP VS FOREACH

DESCRIPTION

forEach() : executes a provided function once for each array element.
map() : Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

OBSERVED DIFFERENCES

map()
-Creates a new array, whereas forEach() changes the original array.
-IMPORTANT!!!: The mapping function will only work if the target of the mapping (Or in other words, the one that's invoking it) is an array. I had a bunch of elements stored inside a variable, and it wouldn't work, until

forEach()
-Doesn't actually return anything (undefined). It simply calls a provided function on each element in your array.
-forEach can actually mutuate the original array based on the function being executed.
-For some reason forEach is not actually mutating the original array, but rather, I've found that you need to push the results somewhere within another empty array, or find other methods of storing your new results
